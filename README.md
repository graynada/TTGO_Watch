# TTGO_Watch

This is a prototype smart watch type project I am developing on an ESP32 powered TTGO T-Display board using Micropython.

Aims of the project are:
  1. Provide a minimum level of functionality
  2. Minimise power usage to make it a viable battery powered device
  3. Add additional nice to have functionality

Minimum functionality is:
  1. Show time and date
  2. Maintain accurate time and date
  3. Receive and alert of messages received on a linked smartphone
